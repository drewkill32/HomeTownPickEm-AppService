Matt Dee found a bug in the games where some games were able to have more points than what is allowed

The way the scoping works is you get "pick" per game plus one extra "pick" for head-to-head games. That is why you can split the point between the two times or use both of the points on one team. I have found 5 games that somehow have extra picks added to the game. What it means is that if picked a game correctly you were awarded extra points than what you should have had. After fixing the issue your point totals are not adjusted

Here is total point adjustment

- Ben Moon -4
- Chris Kellmeyer -3
- Drew Killion -4
- Gene McGrail -4
- Greg Curtis -4
- Greg Renz -4
- Gregg Potter -4
- Jimmy Drennan -4
- Leslie Dempsey -4
- Matt  Kragiel -2
- Matt Dee -2
- Michael Shortell -3
- Ryan Slade -4
- Sean Fogarty -4
